AI Response:
Spring AI is a framework that simplifies the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) functionality into applications. It provides abstractions and infrastructure to make it easier for developers to use AI models and services in their projects. The framework is designed to be easy to use and understand, allowing developers to focus on the AI aspects of their applications without getting bogged down in the complexities of the underlying AI technologies. Spring AI is built on top of the Spring Framework, which is a popular framework for building enterprise applications in Java. The Spring AI project is developed and maintained by the Spring team, and it is released under the Apache License 2.0.
